MRST may download data sets and other utilities from the internet. Disabling this means that no files will be downloaded by default. You can still manually activate downloads through optional inputs.

MRST will ask for permission before downloading files. You can disable these prompts (recommended if you are on an unmetered high-speed connection)

MRST normally asks before attempting to build MEX extensions. If disabled, building happens automatically without user input.

Parts of MRST can be accelerated with compiled extensions (MEX-acceleration). This requires a C/C++ compiler to be set up with Matlab (see 'mex -setup' for more details). Enabling this option will let MRST attempt to compile MEX files when needed. Building of such files can still be triggered manually.

Many MEX extensions include OpenMP support for parallelization. Enable this if you have OpenMP installed.
